# Thavam Motors Production and Operations Management Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of production and operations management at Thavam Motors, aiming to enhance efficiency and productivity across the company's facilities and work processes. By leveraging production and operational management principles, the project seeks to optimize resource utilization, streamline processes, and effectively manage costs. The goal is to underscore the impact of refined production and operational management on the automotive industry.

## Key Areas of Focus

### 1. Demand and Forecasting

- Annual demand is on the rise, with a projected 20% increase in 2023 compared to the previous year.
- Thavam Motors currently produces approximately 30 motor pumps per week.
- Demand exhibits seasonal fluctuations, peaking in specific months and decreasing during the rainy season.
- Recommendation: Align production schedules with seasonal demand patterns to minimize inventory holding costs.

### 2. Process Efficiency

- The casting process is pivotal, taking about 2 days, followed by additional processing at separate workstations and assembly, each also requiring about 2 days.
- Recommendation: Propose modifications to the layout of the production process to optimize workflow efficiency.

### 3. Future Expansion

- Future plans include establishing another factory, launching new sales centers, and intensifying advertising efforts to cater to island-wide demand.
- Budget estimation for these expansions is challenging due to economic fluctuations and variable pricing trends.
